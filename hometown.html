            Taizhou City has a history of over 2100 years of urban construction. It was named Haiyang in the Qin Dynasty
            and Hailing in the Han Dynasty. The state was established during the Southern Tang Dynasty and Wenchang
            during the Northern Song Dynasty. During the Southern Tang Dynasty (937 AD), it was under the jurisdiction
            of the state and was known as "Taizhou". It integrated the charm of Wu, Chu, and Yue, and gathered the wind
            of the Yangtze River, Huai River, and Hai River. In August 1996, Taizhou City was established at the
            prefecture level. Taizhou is home to a wealth of talented people, with Shi Nai'an, Zheng Banqiao, and Mei
            Lanfang being outstanding representatives. There are many places of interest and historic sites, such as
            Guangxiao Temple, Confucian Worship Temple, Chenghuang Temple, Anding Academy, Rishiyuan, Wanghai Tower, Mei
            Lanfang Memorial Hall, and the People's Navy Birthplace Memorial Hall. There are ecological and natural
            scenic spots such as Qinhu Wetland, Qiandao cauliflower, Water Forest, Tiande Lake Park, and Ancient Ginkgo
            Forest.

            Taizhou City is a water and land hub that connects the south and the north, serving as the gateway to
            Suzhong. It has been known since ancient times as a "water and land hub, with a throat based on the
            county."
